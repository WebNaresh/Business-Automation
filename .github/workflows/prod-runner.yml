# Advantages:
# - ⚙️ Automation: Automates the build and deployment process whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
# - 📦 Artifact Management: Uses GitHub Actions to manage and transfer artifacts (the build output) between jobs.

# Disadvantages:
# - 🏠 Self-Hosted Runner Dependency: The "release-project" job relies on a self-hosted runner, which may require additional setup and maintenance.
# - 📝 Limited Explanation: It's recommended to provide more detailed comments or explanations within the workflow file for better documentation and understanding.
